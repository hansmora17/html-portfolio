<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Dune Part 2</h3>

<p>This is the most incredible sci-fi experience I've ever had, it will for sure go in the history books as one of the best of my generation. Not only as sci-fi, but as great cinema!</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>

<p>Martin's Scorsese's epic about 2 catholic priest who infiltrate Shinto Era Japan to help their faith grow in the country, only to find great oposition and their faith tested by horrific acts over and over; a truly astonishing film, that as time passes, might stand out more than Scorsese's ganster films.</p>
<h3>The Shining</h3>

<p>This is the best horror film ever made in my opinion. Every single thing in frame is there with a purpose of creating a truly nightmarish experience, but without stopping to be beautiful. One of my favorite things are filmmakers taking a popular genre like sci-fi or horror, and not letting that stop them from making a true work of art.</p>
